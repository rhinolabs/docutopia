# Docutopia

A modern, interactive API documentation library built on React. Docutopia brings beautiful, type-safe API documentation to your OpenAPI specifications with a focus on simplicity and developer experience.

## Monorepo Structure

This project is structured as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces:

- **`packages/core`** - Core library package (`@docutopia/core`)
  The main Docutopia library that renders interactive API documentation from OpenAPI specifications with built-in testing capabilities.

## Overview

Docutopia simplifies creating beautiful API documentation by providing:

- **Modern React architecture** with clean, responsive UI
- **Interactive API testing** built directly into the documentation
- **Multiple authentication methods** (Bearer Token, API Key, Basic Auth)
- **Automatic cURL generation** for all API requests
- **Dark mode support** out of the box
- **Type-safe development** with full TypeScript support
- **Web Components support** for framework-agnostic integration

## Getting Started

The fastest way to use Docutopia is to install it in your project:

```bash
# Install the package
npm install @docutopia/core

# Or with pnpm
pnpm add @docutopia/core

# Or with yarn
yarn add @docutopia/core
```

Then import and use it in your application:

```jsx
import { Docutopia } from '@docutopia/core';
import '@docutopia/core/dist/style.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Docutopia specUrl="https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json" />
  );
}
```

## Key Features

### üé® Beautiful UI

Modern, clean interface with dark mode support by default:

```jsx
<Docutopia specUrl="https://api.example.com/openapi.json" />
```

That's it! Docutopia automatically renders:
- Organized endpoint navigation by tags
- Request/response schemas with examples
- Interactive parameter fields
- Response visualization

### üîÑ Interactive Testing

Built-in "Try It!" panel for testing endpoints directly:

- Dynamic form generation from OpenAPI schemas
- Support for path, query, and body parameters
- Real-time request/response display
- Automatic validation based on schemas

### üîê Authentication Support

Configure authentication credentials right in the UI:

- **Bearer Token** - JWT and other token-based auth
- **API Key** - Custom header or query parameter keys
- **Basic Auth** - Username/password authentication

Authentication is automatically applied to all requests with proper headers.

### üìã cURL Generation

Every request can be exported as a cURL command:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/users/123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Perfect for sharing API examples or debugging.

### üåê Multiple Integration Options

Use Docutopia as a React component or Web Component:

```html
<!-- As a Web Component -->
<docutopia-viewer
  spec-url="https://api.example.com/openapi.json"
></docutopia-viewer>
```

### üéØ Type-Safe Development

Built with TypeScript for better developer experience:

- Full type inference for OpenAPI schemas
- IntelliSense support in modern editors
- Catch errors during development

## Architecture

- **React 19** - Latest React features for optimal performance
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management
- **TanStack Query** - Powerful async state management
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
